While Woot offers a lower price ($227.99), it is for a refurbished unit. Be wary of significantly lower prices from third-party sellers, which may indicate errors or different product versions. User reports suggest prices can drop as low as $200 during major sales events at retailers like Costco.\n\n### \ud83d\udcca Comparison Matrix\n\n| Product Name                                   | Price       | Condition         | Rating | Reviews | Notes                               |\n|------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------------|--------|---------|-------------------------------------|\n| Sony WH-1000XM5 (Best Buy)                     | **$248.00** \u2b50\u2b50 | New               | 4.7/5  | 22000   | Reputable retailer                  |\n| Sony WH-1000XM5 (Anthropologie)                | $268.00 \u2b50   | New               | 4.7/5  | 22000   | Less common electronics retailer    |\n| Sony WH-1000XM5 (Woot - Refurbished)           | $227.99     | Grade A Refurbished | N/A    | N/A     | Lower price, but not new            |\n| Sony WH-1000XM5 (Walmart - Seller, Int.

While \"Grade A\" suggests good condition, it is not equivalent to a new product and may come with different warranty terms.\n\n#### Sony WH-1000XM5 (Walmart - Seller, International Version)\n**Price:** **$294.95** [4]\n**Condition:** New\n**Rating:** 4.7/5 stars from 22,000 reviews [4]\n**Notes:** This listing specifies \"International Version,\" which could impact warranty, software updates, or feature compatibility in different regions compared to a US model. The price is also higher than other new options.\n\n#### Sony WH-1000XM5 (Walmart - Seller, Erroneous Price)\n**Price:** **$52.38** [5]\n**Condition:** Unknown\n**Rating:** Not available [5]\n**Notes:** This price is extremely low and highly suspect. The product name includes \"Rhea-\" suggesting it may be a different product or a significant listing error. It is not a reliable price point for the Sony WH-1000XM5.\n\n### \u26a0\ufe0f Important Considerations & Conflicts\n\n*   **Price Variation:** There is significant price variation across retailers and sellers, ranging from a suspicious $52.38 to $294.95 for new units, and $227.99 for refurbished [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].\n*   **Condition:** The Woot listing is explicitly for a \"Grade A Refurbished\" product [3], differentiating it from the \"new\" implied or stated condition from Best Buy, Anthropologie, and Walmart [1, 2, 4].\n*   **Product Version:** One Walmart listing mentions an \"International Version\" [4], which may differ from standard US models.\n*   **Anecdotal Pricing:** Reddit users suggest prices have dropped as low as $200 at Costco [6, 7], and occasionally seen for $288 on Amazon [6]. This indicates that deeper sale prices exist, but these are not consistently available across all current listings.\n*   **Rating Consistency:** Most listed new units share a 4.7/5 rating and 22,000 reviews, likely aggregated data [1, 2, 4]. The refurbished and erroneous listings lack this data.\n\n### \ud83d\udcda Sources\n[1] Sony WH-1000XM5 Noise-Canceling Wireless Over-Ear Headphones (Best Buy via Google Shopping) - Credibility: Moderately Credible (Aggregated data from a reputable retailer) | Link: [URL not provided in data]\n[2] Sony Wireless WH-1000XM5 Over-Ear Noise Canceling Headphones (Anthropologie via Google Shopping) - Credibility: Moderately Credible (Less common electronics retailer, aggregated data) | Link: [URL not provided in data]\n[3] Sony WH-1000XM5 Wireless Active Noise Cancelling Headphones (Grade A Refurbished) (Woot via Google Shopping) - Credibility: Low Credibility (Deal site, explicitly refurbished) | Link: [URL not provided in data]\n[4] Sony Wh-1000xm5 The Best Wireless Noise Canceling Headphones, Silver - (International Version) (Walmart Seller via Google Shopping) - Credibility: Moderately Credible (Aggregated data, potential for regional variations) | Link: [URL not provided in data]\n[5] Rhea- Sony Wh-1000Xm5 Wireless Noise Canceling Headphones - Black (Walmart Seller via Google Shopping) - Credibility: Low Credibility (Extremely low price suggests error or different product) | Link: [URL not provided in data]\n[6] Reddit r/SonyHeadphones - \"What is the lowest price that XM5s were on sale?\" - https://www.reddit.com/r/SonyHeadphones/comments/1gppfwa/what_is_the_lowest_price_that_xm5s_were_on_sale/\n    Credibility: Low Credibility (User-generated, anecdotal, may not be current)\n[7] Reddit r/SonyHeadphones - \"Lowest price the XM5s have been?\" - https://www.reddit.com/r/SonyHeadphones/comments/13r0m4f/lowest_price_the_xm5s_have_been/\n    Credibility: Low Credibility (User-generated, anecdotal, may not be current)\n\n---\n\ud83d\udca1 **Follow-up Questions:**\n- What are the specific warranty differences between new US models and the 'International Version' mentioned?\n- How does the performance and feature set of the Sony WH-1000XM5 compare to other top noise-canceling headphones in the $250-$300 price range?\n- What is the typical return policy for refurbished headphones purchased from Woot?\n- Are there any upcoming major sale events (e.g., Black Friday, Prime Day) where deeper discounts are anticipated for the WH-1000XM5?\n- Can you provide a direct link to the Sony WH-1000XM5 product page on Best Buy and Anthropologie?",
